# Data Collection:

We used Amazon’s Product Advertising API to obtain the data in a policy complaint manner, and we acquired data for 1,83,000 products.For each product we obtained Image-url, Title, price etc.For this project we primarily focussed on Women’s Apparel data. Amazon’s Product Advertising API can be used to extract data for other products as well.

## Process
Used the title , color ,brand and the image features to calculate the pairwise distance by converting them into vectors and recommendation product to user.
